## Features

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository to your computer
Run this command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/StefanGerrits2/web-app-from-scratch-1920`
### 2. Navigate into the root of the folder
Run this command in your terminal:

`cd web-app-from-scratch-1920`

### 3. Viewing the website
Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

>
> ###### NOTE:
> You can't just open your `index.html` file because I use es6 modoules. You need to start a live server to make it work. For example, I use the plugin `Preview on Web Server`.
