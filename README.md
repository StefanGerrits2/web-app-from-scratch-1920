# Web app from scratch

## Concept

#### Overview page

#### Detail page: general

#### Detail page: Related beers around the same alcohol percentage

### Description

This is a single page web app that uses the PUNK API to receive beers. The beers are shown in the overview page. I fetch 36 beers each time because you cannot fetch all beers in one go. For this sake, I implemented a loadmore button to load in more data. 

You can click on a beer to checkout the detail page for further information; including ingredients and recipes. There are also related beers shown around the same alcohol percentage. When you click on a related beer you will see the detail page of that beer.

## Features

* Loading in data from the PUNK API
* Loading in more data when you click on a button
* Being able to view a detail page
* Being able to view related beers around the same alcohol by volume on the detail page
* Being able to click a related beer to render the new detail page

Features if I had more time

* Local storage
* Filter / sort on overview page, for example: alcohol by volume, brew date, volume etc
* Search input (auto filter)

## How it works
---
`NOTE:` Local storage is not implemented yet, but this is how it would look if it was implemented.

#### Actor diagram

#### Interaction diagram 

When the app is loaded it will immediately route to `beersOverview`. Then it checks if there's already data available, if yes it renders the `beersOverview`, if not it fetches the data in `API.getBeers()`. When the data is fetched the data will be transformed in `dataHelper()`. After this the `beersOverview` can be rendered.

When the detail page is requested, data already exists because I store that globally because I need to update all current fetched data to render the related beers on every page, and also to still be able to click an item which was fetched earlier. Then the data will be filtered on the item you clicked on, then detail page will be rendered.

## Templating engine

I used the micro library `tiny mustache` which is a javascript library which only does templating. I've never used a templating engine with vanilla javascript before so I had to figure out how this worked. You can basically create a template in your HTML where you decide how the output should be. You can loop over your data, for example with `{{#beers}}` and it closes with `{{/beers}}`. I had some issues with this because I didn't know I had to restructure my data for this to make it happen. This took me a while because I couldn't find a lot of documentation about it, but in the end I figured it out.

In javascript I select the container where my template needs to render in and I pass the data to it and `tiny mustache` does the rest. Before I implemented this templating engine I had a lot of `createElements` and `appendChilds`, this was horrible because this took a lot of the same code to template it.

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository to your computer
Run this command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/StefanGerrits2/web-app-from-scratch-1920`
### 2. Navigate into the root of the folder
Run this command in your terminal:

`cd web-app-from-scratch-1920`

### 3. Viewing the website
Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

> ###### NOTE:
> You can't just open your `index.html` file because I use es6 modoules. You need to start a live server to make it work. For example, I use the plugin `Preview on Web Server`.

## API

#### PUNK API

Returns different kinds of beers with a lot of information, some details are:

* Each IP that makes a request has a rate limit of 3600 requests per hour (1 req/sec)
* No key and authentication needed
* HTTPS

#### Root endpoint

`https://api.punkapi.com/v2/`

There are loads of paramaters which you can add to it, I use:
`per_page` and `page` 

* I use `per_page` to get more items back, because if I don't use this, the amount of items that get returned is limited by 25. 

* I use `page` because I can't fetch everything in one go, if even if this was possible I wouldn't do this because loading all the data could take some time. With the `page` I implemented a load more button to fetch data again with data on the next page in the API.

#### This is how a raw object looks when I fetch it from the API

#### I transformed my data objects to this:
